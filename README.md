## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about semantic HTML, including better structuring and accessibility. I found out that custom properties on ```:root``` don't apply to font-faces.

One of the interesting things I'm trying to develop is how to think of building the css for shared components to be able to better utilize them, and this project helped me better think of my css for this use.

### Continued development

I want to keep improving my components' css in order to be able to make easy-to-use tools.
